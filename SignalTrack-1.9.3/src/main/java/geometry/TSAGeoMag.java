 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE: </b>Comment out the LOG references, and put back in the
 * System.out.println statements if not using log4j in your application. Checks
 * are not made on the method inputs to ensure they are within a valid range.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * 
 * Verified by a JUnit test using the test values distributed with the 2020
 * epoch update.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * 
 * This is a class to generate the magnetic declination, magnetic field strength
 * and inclination for any point on the earth. The true bearing = magnetic
 * bearing + declination. This class is adapted from an Applet from the NOAA
 * National Data Center at <a href ="http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/seg/segd.shtml">
 * http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/seg/segd.shtml.</a> None of the calculations were
 * changed. This class requires an input file named WMM.COF, which must be in
 * the same directory that the application is run from. <br>
 * <b>NOTE:</b> If the WMM.COF file is missing, the internal fit coefficients
 * for 2020 will be used.
 *
 * Using the correct date, the declination is accurate to about 0.5 degrees.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *
 * This is the LANL D-3 version of the GeoMagnetic calculator from the NOAA
 * National Data Center at http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/seg/segd.shtml.

 *
 * Version 2 Comments: The world magnetic model is updated every 5 years. The
 * data for 2000 uses the same algorithm to calculate the magnetic field
 * variables. The only change is in the spherical harmonic coefficients in the
 * input file. The input file has been renamed to WMM.COF. Once again, the date
 * was fixed. This time to January 1, 2001. Also, a deprecated constructor for
 * StreamTokenizer was replaced, and the error messages in the catch clause were
 * changed. Methods to get the field strength and inclination were added.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *
 * Found out some interesting information about the altitude. The altitude
 * entered for the calculations is the height above the WGS84 spheroid, not
 * height MSL. Using MSL height means that the altitude could be in error by as
 * much as 200 meters. This should not be significant for our applications.
 * </p>

 * <b>NOTE:</b> This class is not thread safe.

 *
 *
 * @version 3.0 January 19, 2000
 *          <p>
 *          Updated for 2000 data.
 *          </p>
 *
 * @version 4.0 March 1, 2002
 *          <p>
 *          Changed so that if data file doesn't exist, it uses an internal
 *          version of the coefficients from the 2000 update.
 *          </p>
 *
 *
 * @version 5.0 June 1, 2005
 *          <p>
 *          Changed so that if data file doesn't exist, it uses an internal
 *          version of the coefficients from the 2005 update. Previously, only
 *          calculated the declination at sea level for one date. Now can return
 *          all of the variables as a function of date and altitude. Original
 *          version used float variables. All changed to type double. Does not
 *          check if the input date is within the valid block.
 *          </p>
 *
 * @version 5.1 June 20, 2005
 *          <p>
 *          Fixed a bug discovered by Alvin Liem. In my zeal to clean up
 *          compiler comments I deleted some double casts for integers that
 *          resulted in an integer division being made when double division was
 *          needed.
 *          </p>
 *
 * @version 5.2 June 1, 2006
 *          <p>
 *          Took out the input error variable, which was no longer being used.
 *          Now verified with a JUnit test. Deleted the main() method which
 *          printed a table of test values.
 *          </p>
 * 
 * @version 5.3 January 28, 2009
 *          <p>
 *          Fixed JavaDoc comments, and replaced the StringTokenizer uses with
 *          String.split().
 * 
 * @version 5.4 January 5, 2010
 *          <p>
 *          Updated for 2010 data. The new 2010 WMM.COF values are now used.
 *          Also, added <a href ="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/">
 *          log4j</a> support.
 *          </p>
 * 
 * @version 5.5 October 10, 2012
 *          <p>
 *          Made minor changes. The default date used when the caller does not
 *          input a date is now the epoch + 2.5 years, rather than being a fixed
 *          value. This means that the default date is automatically updated if
 *          a new WMM.COF file is used. Also, now have a method to return the
 *          date as a decimal year, given the Gregorian Calendar date.
 *          </p>
 * 
 * @version 5.6 January 15, 2015
 *          <p>
 *          Updated the internal coefficients to the 2015 values. Passes the new
 *          JUnit tests.
 *          </p>
 * 
 * @version 5.7 May 26, 2015
 *          <p>
 *          Martin Frassl discovered a major bug in the code. I thought that X
 *          was in the East direction. It is not. The X axis is in the North
 *          direction. This is now fixed so that getNorthIntensity and
 *          getEastIntensity return the correct values. Thank you Martin!. The
 *          X, Y, and Z axes are defined in table 1 of the reference:

	 * <p>
	 * <b>PURPOSE:</b> THIS ROUTINE COMPUTES THE DECLINATION (DEC), INCLINATION
	 * (DIP), TOTAL INTENSITY (TI) AND GRID VARIATION (GV - POLAR REGIONS ONLY,
	 * REFERENCED TO GRID NORTH OF POLAR STEREOGRAPHIC PROJECTION) OF THE EARTH'S
	 * MAGNETIC FIELD IN GEODETIC COORDINATES FROM THE COEFFICIENTS OF THE CURRENT
	 * OFFICIAL DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE (DOD) SPHERICAL HARMONIC WORLD MAGNETIC MODEL
	 * (WMM-2010). THE WMM SERIES OF MODELS IS UPDATED EVERY 5 YEARS ON JANUARY 1'ST
	 * OF THOSE YEARS WHICH ARE DIVISIBLE BY 5 (I.E. 1980, 1985, 1990 ETC.) BY THE
	 * NAVAL OCEANOGRAPHIC OFFICE IN COOPERATION WITH THE BRITISH GEOLOGICAL SURVEY
	 * (BGS). THE MODEL IS BASED ON GEOMAGNETIC SURVEY MEASUREMENTS FROM AIRCRAFT,
	 * SATELLITE AND GEOMAGNETIC OBSERVATORIES.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 *
	 *
	 *
	 * <b>ACCURACY:</b> IN OCEAN AREAS AT THE EARTH'S SURFACE OVER THE ENTIRE 5 YEAR
	 * LIFE OF A DEGREE AND ORDER 12 SPHERICAL HARMONIC MODEL SUCH AS WMM-95, THE
	 * ESTIMATED RMS ERRORS FOR THE VARIOUS MAGENTIC COMPONENTS ARE:
	 * </p>
	 * <ul>
	 * DEC - 0.5 Degrees<br>
	 * DIP - 0.5 Degrees<br>
	 * TI - 280.0 nanoTeslas (nT)<br>
	 * GV - 0.5 Degrees<br>
	 * </ul>
	 *
	 * <p>
	 * OTHER MAGNETIC COMPONENTS THAT CAN BE DERIVED FROM THESE FOUR BY SIMPLE
	 * TRIGONOMETRIC RELATIONS WILL HAVE THE FOLLOWING APPROXIMATE ERRORS OVER OCEAN
	 * AREAS:
	 * </p>
	 * <ul>
	 * X - 140 nT (North)<br>
	 * Y - 140 nT (East)<br>
	 * Z - 200 nT (Vertical) Positive is down<br>
	 * H - 200 nT (Horizontal)<br>
	 * </ul>
	 *
	 * <p>
	 * OVER LAND THE RMS ERRORS ARE EXPECTED TO BE SOMEWHAT HIGHER, ALTHOUGH THE RMS
	 * ERRORS FOR DEC, DIP AND GV ARE STILL ESTIMATED TO BE LESS THAN 0.5 DEGREE,
	 * FOR THE ENTIRE 5-YEAR LIFE OF THE MODEL AT THE EARTH's SURFACE. THE OTHER
	 * COMPONENT ERRORS OVER LAND ARE MORE DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE AND SO ARE NOT
	 * GIVEN.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 *
	 * THE ACCURACY AT ANY GIVEN TIME OF ALL FOUR GEOMAGNETIC PARAMETERS DEPENDS ON
	 * THE GEOMAGNETIC STATION_LATITUDE_DEGREES. THE ERRORS ARE LEAST AT THE EQUATOR
	 * AND GREATEST AT THE MAGNETIC POLES.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 *
	 * IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT A DEGREE AND ORDER 12 MODEL, SUCH AS
	 * WMM-2010 DESCRIBES ONLY THE LONG WAVELENGTH SPATIAL MAGNETIC FLUCTUATIONS DUE
	 * TO EARTH'S CORE. NOT INCLUDED IN THE WMM SERIES MODELS ARE INTERMEDIATE AND
	 * SHORT WAVELENGTH SPATIAL FLUCTUATIONS OF THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WHICH
	 * ORIGINATE IN THE EARTH'S MANTLE AND CRUST. CONSEQUENTLY, ISOLATED ANGULAR
	 * ERRORS AT VARIOUS POSITIONS ON THE SURFACE (PRIMARILY OVER LAND, IN
	 * CONTINENTAL MARGINS AND OVER OCEANIC SEAMOUNTS, RIDGES AND TRENCHES) OF
	 * SEVERAL DEGREES MAY BE EXPECTED. ALSO NOT INCLUDED IN THE MODEL ARE
	 * NONSECULAR TEMPORAL FLUCTUATIONS OF THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD OF MAGNETOSPHERIC
	 * AND IONOSPHERIC ORIGIN. DURING MAGNETIC STORMS, TEMPORAL FLUCTUATIONS CAN
	 * CAUSE SUBSTANTIAL DEVIATIONS OF THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD FROM MODEL VALUES. IN
	 * ARCTIC AND ANTARCTIC REGIONS, AS WELL AS IN EQUATORIAL REGIONS, DEVIATIONS
	 * FROM MODEL VALUES ARE BOTH FREQUENT AND PERSISTENT.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 *
	 * IF THE REQUIRED DECLINATION ACCURACY IS MORE STRINGENT THAN THE WMM SERIES OF
	 * MODELS PROVIDE, THEN THE USER IS ADVISED TO REQUEST SPECIAL (REGIONAL OR
	 * LOCAL) SURVEYS BE PERFORMED AND MODELS PREPARED BY THE USGS, WHICH OPERATES
	 * THE US GEOMAGNETIC OBSERVATORIES. REQUESTS OF THIS NATURE SHOULD BE MADE
	 * THROUGH NIMA AT THE ADDRESS ABOVE.
